One of my favorite things to do is build stuff — like furniture and the internet 🤓

For the latter, I like or am learning:

```text
JavaScript, React.js, Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, Go, Data Visualization, Headless CMS, 
JAM-stack, Python, Docker, TypeScript, Cypress, Node.js, PostgreSQL, UX & user interaction design
```

  - 🐶  a data management platform for tracking shelter animals around the country 
  - 🌳  an application allowing land owners to be paid for keeping their forests to sequester CO2 emissions


- 🌱  I’m currently learning GraphQL
- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on mission-driven projects that help the natural world
